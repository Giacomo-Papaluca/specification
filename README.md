# Shape Trees Specification

This repository contains the specification and supporting documentation
for [Shape Trees](https://shapetrees.org).

Shape trees marry RDF vocabularies, shapes, and resources into "little trees"
that provide machine to machine interoperability, combining them into concepts
that humans can easily comprehend, such as medical records, notes, notebooks,
calendars, and financial records.

For applications that operate on more complex and interconnected resources,
Shape Trees express the layout of those resources and associate them with
their respective shapes.
